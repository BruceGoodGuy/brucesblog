        <h3>Services</h3>
        <p>
          I help ambitious businesses like yours generate more profits by
          building awareness, driving web traffic, connecting with customers and
          growing overall sales. My only working rule is that I don't work
          through agencies, I prefer to communicate directly with clients.

              <h3>Web &amp; Product Design</h3>
              <p>
                From low-fidelity wireframing and prototyping to a final coded
                design. We don't just hand off static designs, but enjoy working
                directly in the browser (â™¥ CSS) as much as with design tools
                such a <a class="fn__link" href="#">Figma</a>. We use can also
                setup complete sites in
                <a class="fn__link" href="#">Statamic</a> and
                <a class="fn__link" href="#">Kirby</a> and work alongside
                front-end developers to provide a complete service.

              <h3>Brand Identity</h3>
              <p>
                From a single logomark to
                <a class="fn__link" href="#">a full branding system</a>. A brand
                new logo may not be the answer for you, we strongly believe in
                refining and updating existing logos to increase effectiveness
                without losing brand equity.

              <h3>Iconography</h3>
              <p>
                This is a speciality of ours, and we have worked with Skype,
                Spotify and Dyson (to name just a few). The process of reducing
                an idea to it's simplest, but still recognisable form is joyous!

              <h3>Print</h3>
              <p>
                We come from a traditional print publishing background, starting
                in the last days of paste up artwork.
